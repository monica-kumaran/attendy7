Hacked an attendance taker for Tech Firm Leadership class :] 

1. Students download any QR Scanner app.
2. Owner creates a QR code.
   a. Code prompts sending email with secret password as title.
   b. Students write in name as message. 
3. Google Script automatically reads emails in inbox and timestamps attendance. 


Things could add:
Sending back confirmation email to students.
Cleaning spreadsheet so keeps running total of attendance.
Making github pg spiffier with form submission so generates QR code in site.

Overall quick&easy and difficult for students to game.
